# TicTacToe

End goal: produce an environment to analyze the efficacy of different AI techniques (minimax+a/b, deep learning, reinforcement learning, etc) 
in playing TicTacToe. Metrics considered will include winrate and computation time. This will serve as a stepping stone in understanding
and developing these advanced algorithms, and to eventually implement them in more complex AI challenges such as chess.

TODO: 
- Implement a DRL algorithm
???
- Transfer algorithms to chess

Completed:
- Complete minimax+a/b algorithm
- Add analysis functions (winrate and computation time)
- Develop self-play algorithm (Sarsa)
